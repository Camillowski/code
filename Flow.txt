AIM:
I want to have a universal makefile for my projects.

USER STORIES:
1. DONE I want just write the name of main file(np. Program, Game etc.), name of the headers(contain .cpp) and required libraries.

2. DONE I want make file to collect data and compile all files that I have put and link them with main file.

3. DONE I do not want to have any complex dependencies, like functions .cpp needs additional .cpp files to work.

4. I want to have possibility to add option (Y/N) to build debug config and place it in debug folder.
When I turn debug on insid prog.sh I want to have debug flag passed to makefile and after that gdb run from prog.sh
	-Add -debug to CFLAG if $1 is set to debug


5. DONE I want to check if included files has chnged. If yes then recompile all

6. I want to show echo when debug mode is set.

6. Project structure
